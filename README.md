## Programming a Tic Tac Toe Game In Python

Hello and welcome to this note you left for yourself, future self. This repository is dedicated to the archival of the guided work you did in Python on a Tic Tac Toe game as part of Jose Portilla's Python Boot Camp course purchased from Udemy. You were 45% completed with the course at this time and this was the first of three projects Jose had lined up for students. Participation in this course was part of your master plan to achieve _TensorFlow_ certification within one year. You conceived of this master plan after meditating one day at the beginning of July and after watching the episode of It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia where the gang is in court defending Bill Ponderosa.

You are currently studying in one-hour-and-five-minute intervals with breaks of varying time between each session. If you were in the middle of something when the timer went off, you continued until a reasonable conclusion. As of this writing, you had been able to sleep for seven consecutive days and have been free of panic attacks during that time. This is a record since 2008. Additionally, you had not drank alcohol for more than three months after spending a night out celebrating a cousin's birthday. That was a single blip in what had been three years completely sober.

This README.md writing is chewing up time in my 1:05.00, so I am going to end here. But these journals are good for a lot of reasons and allow me to reflect on what it is exactly that I am doing.

Update from July 27, 2023: I'm raring to go after an eighth successive night of sleep and an eighth morning walk of an hour or greater. I'm building a tic tac toe game today.

Update from July 28, 2023: So, I'm realizing that I really enjoy coding along with people on video. A byproduct of that is that I also learn a great deal. Kind of how imagination and consciousness are byproducts of the human language instinct, my learning has really always been the best when I was doing things. An example of this is how I was really terrible in the K-12 school environment but excelled in the labs and more applied learning environments of college and military training.

So with that in mind, I'm going to continue with my Python course hosted by the above-mentioned Jose Portilla. However, I'm going to do some side learning hustles along the way. This will involve YouTube code along videos dealing with the concepts I'm learning in Jose's course along with proceeding through the course. Jose has dropped hints that we should do these kinds of things. So I'm not really blazing a trail in terms of this new course of learning. It just seems more natural. And there wouldn't be a huge amount of videos on YouTube expressly dedicated to coding along if this wasn't something that was uniqe. So I guess I'm just getting with the program! With that said, this is what I'm going to be working on today and tonight:

I'll add more below if I get there. Until next time, future self, remember -- 42!
